# 5e-database

Holds the database for the D&D 5th Edition API at http://dnd5eapi.co/

__Note from Author__
So I have a full time job now and am exploring other pursuits outside of work that aren't coding related (sports, music, etc). I've preety much let the reins on this project go to anyone who wants it.

# helper.js

example command:

```
node helper features
```

* creates an upload file for the features collection
* automatically reindexes and creates URL's for each JSON object
* prints out a mongodb command to upload the database to MongoLab
